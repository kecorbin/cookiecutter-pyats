# * Description:
# *    This is a local library file that lives with the testscript. Local
# *    libraries contains functions, classes & methods local to a testscript
# *    only. Because they are local and are not shared with other
# *    scripts/modules, the use of them should be minimized (not used if
# *    possible). Common code/libraries should be shared with the testing
# *    community in repositories such as xbu_shared.
# *
# * Note:
# *   the use of local library files, and its ideas, are software development
# *   methodologies, and an optional use-case of pyATS testscripts.

# ****************************************************************************
# * Function & Class Defitions
# *
# *  Local library functions should support the use of steps: creating smaller
# *  steps within test sections to identify the actions taken in a library
# *  function.
# *
# *  to use step in your functions, provide it the current step object, and
# *  create further step swithin your functions.
def template_library_function(step):
    '''template_library_function

    This function demonstrate the use of steps within function APIs. This
    enables smaller breakdown of functions into smaller steps, and thus
    provides finer granuality in your testscript logs.

    Arguments
    ---------
        steps   (obj): the step object to be passed in from the testscript

    '''

    with step.start('function step one'):
        # do some meaningful testing
        pass

    with step.start('function step two'):
        # do some meaningful testing
        pass

    with step.start('function step three'):
        # do some meaningful testing
        pass

    return
